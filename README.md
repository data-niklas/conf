# conf

A very simple and minimal configuration file parser<br>
It builds on top of the Crystal TOML parser

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     conf:
       github: data-niklas/conf
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "conf"
```

Just look at the source code.<br>
Seriously! There are just about ~60 lines of code (without the spaces inbetween)
